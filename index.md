## Abstract

These pages are intended to get you up and running with assembly for MSX1. The focus will be mainly on how to get from code to a running program on an *emulated* and *real* MSX. The page won't go deep into learning actual assembly. There are excellent resources for that. I can recommend you to look at:

- [Learn Multi platform Z80 Assembly Programming... With Vampires!](https://www.chibiakumas.com/z80/)
-  [MSX2-Technical-Handbook](https://konamiman.github.io/MSX2-Technical-Handbook/)

- [MSX Assembly Page](http://map.grauw.nl)



## What you need

For developing on a PC or Mac, you need

- a text editor, it can be [anything](https://neovim.io) you like,

- an assembler, e.g. [VASM](http://www.compilers.de/vasm.html) or [Glass](http://www.grauw.nl/projects/glass/),
- an emulator, e.g. [openMSX](https://openmsx.org), optionally with [debugger](https://openmsx.org).

For developing on a real MSX1, I will show

- [Champ, by PSS](https://download.file-hunter.com/Games/MSX1/CAS/Champ%20(1984)(PSS)%5BBLOAD'CAS-'%2CR%5D.zip). For me, it  was the best assembler for MSX1. It has a build in editor, debugger and monitor, all running on a MSX1. Fun fact: Champ has been created by the legendary [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie), the creator of the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).
