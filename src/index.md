# MSX Assembly page for beginners

_Gilbert Fran√ßois Duivesteijn_



## Abstract

Around 1986, as a young boy, I did some assembly programming on the MSX using Champ Assembler. I found it hard to learn. There was no internet and I had no access to many books on this topic . Moreover, if you were stuck, you could not reach out to a forum or StackOverflow. Now, I started again to learn and refresh some knowledge on this topic. However, having modern computers and cross compiling is possible, it was still not trivial to get the first code running on a real MSX computer. 



These pages are intended to get you up and running with assembly for MSX1. The focus will be mainly on how to get from code to a running program on an *emulated* and *real* MSX. The page won't go deep into learning actual assembly. There are excellent resources for that. I can recommend you to look at:

- [Learn Multi platform Z80 Assembly Programming... With Vampires!](https://www.chibiakumas.com/z80/)
-  [MSX2-Technical-Handbook](https://konamiman.github.io/MSX2-Technical-Handbook/)

- [MSX Assembly Page](http://map.grauw.nl)

## What you need

For developing on a PC or Mac, you need

- a text editor, it can be [anything](https://neovim.io) you like,

- an assembler, e.g. [VASM](http://www.compilers.de/vasm.html) or [Glass](http://www.grauw.nl/projects/glass/),
- an emulator, e.g. [openMSX](https://openmsx.org), optionally with [debugger](https://openmsx.org).

For developing on a real MSX1, I will show

- [Champ, by PSS](https://download.file-hunter.com/Games/MSX1/CAS/Champ%20(1984)(PSS)%5BBLOAD'CAS-'%2CR%5D.zip). For me, it  was the best assembler for MSX1. It has a build in editor, debugger and monitor, all running on a MSX1. Fun fact: Champ has been created by the legendary [Dennis Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie), the creator of the [C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).
