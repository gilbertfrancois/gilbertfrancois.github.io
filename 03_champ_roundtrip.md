# Champ: Assembler -> Basic -> Assembler roundtrip

*Gilbert Fran√ßois Duivesteijn*

In this example, I loosly follow *ChibiAkumas'* tutorial [Learn Z80 Assembly Lesson 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPXmvoZz9Nk&list=PLp_QNRIYljFq-9nFiAUiAkRzAXfcZTBR_&index=3). Please check out his lesson to learn what the code is doing.  We will make a small program in assembly that performs an add or subtract operation on single byte integers. We will make:

- Basic program that asks for the user input and shows the result.
- ASM program that computes and stores the result in memory.

 Please follow the steps below:



| Instructions                                                 | Screenshots          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Use **insert** and **edit** to type in the example program. To learn about the key bindings, please refer to this [page](03_champ_1.html). | ![](03_champ001.png) |
| In **assemble** mode, type `a` `2` to compile. Change cassettes to and save the listing as text to cassette with `s` -> `filename`. | ![](03_champ002.png) |
| Go to **debug** mode by pressing `m`, view the disassembled code in memory with `Q saddr`. If you want, you can store your finished binary to cassette with: `W saddr faddr filename`. | ![](03_champ004.png) |
| Go back to assemble mode by pressing `a`. Go back to basic with `q` `y` and type in the listing above. | ![](03_champ005.png) |
| If all is well, type `run` and see if your program works.    | ![](03_champ006.png) |
| You can go back to the Assembler by accessing the memory address **&H8400** and edit/update your asm program. | ![](03_champ007.png) |
